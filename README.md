  <br/>
  
  Videogames APP is a SPA (Single Page Aplication) developed by me through mi course at Henry's Bootcamp. It consumes RAWG's API and an own Data Base and uses the data to display a list of videogames, including their poster, name, general ranking and genres. This list can be ordered alphabetically or by ranking, and filtered by genre and data source. The app also allows users to create a new videgoame, which data will be stored at the project's DB, as well as a search bar to find any videogame which name matches the search parameter. Game detail's view offers aditional info, such as a game description, the platforms is it available on and it-s release date.
